-- Scale up API to loop through dates and gather more data... 
-- we will need to do this to maximize data output and not waste free api calls
-- set api to poll in 30 min intervals
-- change logic to run commands on two day intervals, and post each batch
-- add logic to retreive new key if current key is invalid
